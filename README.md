**E-Commerce Recommendation Engine: 
Leveraging SQL for Personalized Shopping Experiences**


**Problem Statement:**

●	An e-commerce platform wants to enhance its user experience and optimize product recommendations based on user interactions and past purchase history. 

●	The platform seeks to identify patterns in user behavior, such as popular products, frequently interacted categories, and purchasing habits, to provide personalized recommendations and improve customer engagement.

**Solution Overview - SQL Implementation for E-commerce Recommendation Engine:**

Data Modeling and Database Design:

●	Design and create tables to store user interactions, product details, and past purchases.
●	Define appropriate data types, primary keys, and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
●	Normalize the database schema to minimize redundancy and optimize query performance.

Data Analysis and Exploration:

●	Utilize SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the database tables.
●	Analyze user interactions by counting views, clicks, and purchases for each product.
●	Identify popular products, frequently interacted categories, and user preferences through SQL aggregation functions and group by clauses.

User Segmentation and Profiling:

●	Segment users based on their interaction history and purchasing behavior using SQL queries.
●	Group users into clusters using techniques such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering.
●	Create user profiles by aggregating user data, including demographics, preferences, and purchase history.
